This was one of my first c++ maya plugins.  I'm uploading it in effort that someone will make it faster.  It's pretty quick, but unfortunately does not draw as fast as the default maya locator for right now.  Which is really too bad, Maya has been in need of a 'null' with built in openGL shapes for a long time.
